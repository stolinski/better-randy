 * Only the corpus half of this route resolves here. The session composition a

 * browser-scoped session is one the origin cannot see and must never be sent —
 * so the page resolves that half itself, against the same store WebMCP uses
 * (ADR-0053). What the server knows is the Starter this build ships.
 *
 * A public host knows one Starter fewer: a fixture is development-only
 * (ADR-0039), so its slug resolves to nothing there rather than opening a
 * composition the homepage does not list.
