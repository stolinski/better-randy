/**
 * What every authoring operation proves before it acts, and the corrective
 * refusal it returns when a proof fails
 * ([ADR-0054](../../../docs/adr/0054-webmcp-operation-transaction-and-security-contract.md) §3, §7).
 *
 * Four checks are shared by every family, whatever an operation's effect kind:
 * the operation is a row the inventory declares, a composition is open, the
 * transition snapshot path does not currently own engine state, and the
 * caller's observed Composition revision is still current. A `write` runs them
 * inside `runCompositionEditTransaction`; a `lifecycle`, `read`, or session
 * operation never opens a draft and so runs them here, which is why they live
 * in one module rather than inside the transaction.
 *
 * Every refusal names one code, the exact value it rejected, and the valid
 * alternatives — "invalid input" on its own is a defect, not a refusal.
