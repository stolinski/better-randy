/**
 * Request-time security decisions for the public export transport (ADR-0052).
 *
 * `public-export-limits.ts` decides how much work a caller may ask for; this
 * module decides whether the caller is allowed to ask at all. Both are pure and
 * allocation-free so the export session store can refuse a request before it
 * touches ffmpeg, the filesystem, or another visitor's session.
 *
 * The public demo has no accounts, so an export session is bound to the browser
 * that opened it by a private credential the origin issues once and the browser
 * returns on every later request. The session identity travels in the URL and is
 * therefore visible to logs and to `Referer`; the credential travels only in a
 * `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict` cookie, so a cross-site page can neither read it
 * nor make the browser send it. That pairing is what makes a download
 * authorization rather than a guessable public link.
 *
 * Deliberately free of Node imports: the same decisions are exercised by
 * fixtures, by the server transport, and by the public-runtime probe.
