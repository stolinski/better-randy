// by the Pack key as a small area light and by an analytic studio
// environment: the Pack field bouncing up from the floor under a dim neutral
// ceiling. The result is tone-compressed and sRGB-encoded at the end of the
// body pass, so a body's albedo displays as the colour its registry declares
// under unit light and composes with the display-space captures around it.
// The captured planes stay in display space; only computed bodies pay for
