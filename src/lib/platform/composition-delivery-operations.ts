/**
 * The `delivery` family: turning the composition into a file the visitor
 * receives
 * ([ADR-0054](../../../docs/adr/0054-webmcp-operation-transaction-and-security-contract.md) §2, §7).
 *
 * One call, one `AbortSignal`, one receipt. There is deliberately no progress
 * tool: a second way to ask about work already started invites a busy loop, and
 * the export either finishes or it does not. The receipt is issued only after
 * the encoded file exists and its download has been handed to the browser — a
 * cancelled or failed run returns `cancelled` or `export_failed`, never a
 * success receipt naming a file nobody has.
 *
 * The export takes no format argument. Format, orientation, rate, and
 * background fill are `transport`'s decisions, and they are what classify the
 * output: a piece exported in a format its own document does not declare would
 * carry a filename and an alpha lane the composition disagrees with. So the
 * corrective path for "export this as ProRes" is `transport.set-format` and
 * then this, which is also why this operation takes the observed revision — it
 * ships one specific version of the document.
