/**
 * What a decoded public export must contain, lane by lane (ADR-0052).

 * `public-export-limits.ts` decides what the export transport admits and
 * `public-export-cleanup.ts` decides what it releases. This module decides
 * whether the file that came back out is the one that was asked for: the codec
 * and chroma layout of its lane, the native target size it was rendered at, one
 * decoded frame per uploaded frame on an even cadence, the output class its
 * alpha claims, and — frame for frame — the pixels the browser presented.
 *
 * Every expectation is derived from the request shape the caller declared, so a
 * measurement is judged against the export it belongs to rather than against a
 * stored golden file. `scripts/probe-public-export-decode-matrix.ts` takes the
 * measurements and this module returns the verdict, which is why it is
