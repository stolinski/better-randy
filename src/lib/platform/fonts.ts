/**
 * Font readiness gate (general engine capability).

 * Each Pack declares its typefaces (`PackManifest.fonts`). Built-in packs
 * register their `@font-face` rules from their own folder (`@fontsource`
 * imports); a User Pack's faces arrive at runtime through
 * `registerUserPackFontFaces` against the same-origin font cache (ADR-0055).
 * This module triggers the declared faces to load and resolves once they are
 * ready, so the HTML-in-Canvas capture — in both preview and export — never
 * rasterizes OS-fallback glyphs. The engine knows nothing about which
 * typefaces a channel uses; that is Pack data.
