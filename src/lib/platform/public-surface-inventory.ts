 *
 * ADR-0053 draws the line: a route that reads or writes durable content on a
 * visitor's behalf, reads the repository, or answers a control-plane question is
 * development-only and is excluded from the public artifact; a route that serves
 * the app, or performs a bounded operation that destroys its own output, is
 * public. That decision was prose. This is the executable form of it — one row
 * per surface, matched by longest path prefix, so "is this reachable publicly?"
 * has exactly one answer and adding a route means adding its row.
 *
 * The exclusion is enforced in the server hook rather than at the route, because
 * a surface that should not exist publicly must not be reachable at all: it
 * answers 404 before its module reads a body, touches disk, or spawns anything.
 *
 * Deliberately free of Node and `$env` imports, like its `public-runtime-contract`
 * peer, so the hook, the tests, and the production-image gate read one inventory.
