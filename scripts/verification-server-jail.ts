/**
 * The throwaway world a verification run is allowed to touch.
 *
 * A probe used to spawn its server with no explicit `cwd`, inherit the primary
 * checkout, and be handed the author's real composition store — which is how the
 * browser-session-integrity probe deleted about thirty compositions on
 * 2026-08-29. Every harness that starts a GFX server now creates a jail first and
 * spawns with `{ cwd, env: { ...process.env, ...jail.environment } }`, so the
 * server's store, export scratch space, and browser profile are all directories
 * this run made and this run removes.
 *
 * `scripts/check-verification-spawn-hygiene.mjs` fails the build when a harness
 * spawn skips any of that.
