# GFX

**License:** [FSL-1.1-ALv2](LICENSE.md) — Fair Source now, with Apache 2.0 becoming available for each release after two years. If the WebMCP Challenge requires an OSI-approved license, I’m open to relicensing the challenge release.

A motion-graphics engine on a web stack. It runs on your own machine, where the
full ProRes export lane lives, and at [gfx.computer](https://gfx.computer),
where the browser renders and encodes every export itself and the origin keeps
nothing. The docs are at [docs.gfx.computer](https://docs.gfx.computer).

GFX renders broadcast-quality motion pieces at native 4K: **transparent
overlays** you composite over footage in an editor, and **full-frame** segments
and bumpers. A piece is a JSON **Preset** that composes five Layers (Surface,
Block, Annotation, Overlay, Effect) from a Pipeline registry. A swappable
**Pack** supplies the appearance — the engine is general, the look is not. Every
piece reflows between horizontal (YouTube) and vertical (TikTok, Reels) targets
with platform safe-areas.

A person authors in the browser GUI. An agent authors through WebMCP. Both act
on the same visible composition.

Rendering is TypeGPU/WebGPU plus WICG HTML-in-Canvas, animated with GSAP and
encoded through Mediabunny and ffmpeg. Every frame is driven from an explicit
timestamp, so preview and export produce the same pixels at the same time.

## Running it locally

Node 24 or newer, and pnpm.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # http://localhost:7263
```

Chrome needs `--enable-blink-features=CanvasDrawElement` to render the canvas.
An unflagged browser is gated: the app shows a full-screen notice with the
launch command instead of rendering anything approximate. Start the combined
CanvasDrawElement+WebMCP agent browser — the default for local agent use — with:

```sh
CDP_BROWSER_MODE=agent scripts/launch-cdp-chrome.sh   # CDP port 9229
```

## Checks

```sh
pnpm check           # svelte-check, eslint, discoverability
pnpm test            # vitest
pnpm verify-presets  # render and measure the Preset corpus
```

## License

Except for third-party components that carry their own license notices, GFX is
available under the [Functional Source License 1.1 with an Apache 2.0 Future
License](LICENSE.md) (`FSL-1.1-ALv2`). The source is Fair Source rather than Open
Source while the FSL terms apply. Each version gains Apache 2.0 as an additional
license on the second anniversary of the date that version was made available.
